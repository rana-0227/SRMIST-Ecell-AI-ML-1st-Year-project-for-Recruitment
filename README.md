# SRMIST-Ecell-AI-ML-1st-Year-project-for-Recruitment
This Python project works with student marks, utilizing lists and dictionaries to store roll_no, name, subjects, and their marks. There are functions to add, display edit and delete student records, find and display highest marks/ highest marks by student, and calculate class average. The console interface displays all results well.
